# Healthcare Chatbot for SIH

This project is a healthcare chatbot developed for the Smart India Hackathon (SIH). It leverages a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, a suite of custom MCP (Multi-Capability-Package) tools, and a sophisticated LangGraph-based workflow to provide comprehensive and multilingual healthcare support.

## Features

- **Multilingual Support:** The chatbot can understand and respond to queries in Odia and Hindi, in addition to English.
- **RAG-based Knowledge Base:** The chatbot can answer questions by retrieving information from a knowledge base of medical documents.
- **Symptom Checker:** Users can describe their symptoms to get information about possible conditions.
- **Report Summarizer:** The chatbot can summarize medical reports.
- **Diet and Nutrition Advice:** Users can get diet and nutrition recommendations.
- **Mental Health Support:** The chatbot provides mental health support.
- **Tavily Web Search:** The chatbot can search the web for information using the Tavily MCP tool.

## Architecture

The chatbot's architecture is composed of three main components: a RAG pipeline, a set of MCP tools, and a LangGraph-powered workflow.

### RAG Pipeline

The RAG pipeline is responsible for ingesting and indexing medical documents to create a searchable knowledge base.

- **Data Ingestion:** Scripts are provided to ingest data from a local MinIO Docker image.
- **Vectorization:** The ingested data is vectorized and stored in a local Qdrant Docker image.
- **FastAPI Endpoints:** The RAG pipeline is exposed through a set of FastAPI endpoints, which are used by the chatbot to query the knowledge base.

### MCP Tools

The chatbot is equipped with a variety of MCP tools that provide specialized functionalities:

- **RAG Query Tool:** Queries the RAG pipeline to answer questions from the knowledge base.
- **Symptom Checker MCP Tool:** Analyzes user-described symptoms and provides information about possible conditions.
- **Report Summarizer MCP Tool:** Summarizes medical reports.
- **Diet and Nutrition MCP Tool:** Provides diet and nutrition advice.
- **Mental Health MCP Tool:** Offers mental health support.
- **Tavily MCP Tool:** Searches the web for information.

### LangGraph Flow

The chatbot's logic is orchestrated by a LangGraph-based workflow that consists of three main agents:

1.  **Translation Agent 1:** This agent receives the user's query and detects its language (Odia, Hindi, or English). It then translates the query to English and stores both the translated query and the original language in the agent state.

2.  **Health Agent:** This agent takes the translated query from the state and determines which MCP tool(s) to use to answer the query. It can use the RAG query tool to access the knowledge base or any of the other specialized MCP tools. The agent then generates a response and stores it in the state.

3.  **Translation Agent 2:** This agent takes the response generated by the Health Agent and translates it back to the user's original language. The translated response is then presented to the user.
